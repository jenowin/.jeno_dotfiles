# .bashrc is only sourced when accessing c:\cygwin\bin\bash.exe from any shells but
# .bash_profile is only sourced in mintty terminal
# to solve that here is the solution
if [ -f ~/.bash_profile ]
then
  . ~/.bash_profile
fi

# when we not set env variable (/cygwin/c/cygwin/bin) path in windows, we cant access commands like vim.exe or clear.exe or any other commands when using c:\cygwin64\bin\bash.exe, To fix(access) that we can use export the path
export PATH=$PATH:"/cygdrive/c/cygwin64/bin/"
